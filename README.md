# Structify_Take_Home_Interview_Solution
In My Chord_intersect.py file I have proposed an O(nlogn) appraoch to solve the Chord_intersection problem. 
There are many thoughts and approaches that I tried and implement and finally coded the most optimal approach. I would also like to disscus all my approaches.

Optimal Appraoch (Coded Solution):
* The solution is built on the basic idea that if a chord starts after the start of an other chord but before it ends, and ends after the first chord ends then these chords definately intersect.
